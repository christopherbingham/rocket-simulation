# Computing Project

This project models the flight characteristics of a satellite launch vehicle (Atlas V rocket) after takeoff from Earth. It is modelled on United Launch Allianceâ€™s user guide for Atlas V Launch Services. It can plot key performance parameters, e.g. altitude, acceleration and velocity with respect to time after
launch, as well as export the results. It takes into account thrust characteristics of the engine, aerodynamic drag, a changing total mass - including payload, number of rocket engine, time of jettison plus many others. The system parameters can be varied and the program is setup to run for an Atlas V 500 by default, but can be changed
